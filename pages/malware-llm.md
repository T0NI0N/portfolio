Malware Detection at the Edge with Lightweight LLMs: A Performance Evaluation. ACM Trans. Internet Technol. To appear


### Thesis' Summary - Chapter 1: Introduction

In recent years, the rapid growth of malware attacks has led to the need for new detection methods, especially in resource-limited edge computing environments. Traditional malware detection techniques, while essential, have had a hard time keeping up with the increasing complexity and adaptability of modern malware threats.  
This challenge has encouraged a shift toward exploring new approaches, such as using lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs), to improve malware detection
capabilities at the edge. By using LLMs, researchers hope to boost detection accuracy, adaptability in real time, and ongoing learning while tackling the limitations of edge devices, such as limited processing power, memory, and energy efficiency.  
Among the various lightweight LLMs, models like DistilBERT, TinyBERT, Llama-3.2-1B, DistilGPT-2, and TinyT5 have shown promise for edge deployment. These
models use techniques like knowledge distillation, pruning, and quantization to significantly reduce their size and computing requirements while retaining much of the pattern recognition and understanding capabilities of larger models. This makes them particularly effective for processing and analyzing complex, unstructured data streams in real time, which is crucial for effective malware detection. By integrating
these models into edge security frameworks, it is possible to enhance threat identification with better accuracy, lower latency, and learning methods that continuously update detection strategies based on changing malware behaviors.  

However, despite their potential, putting LLMs to work for malware detection in edge environments comes with several key challenges:  
- Model Performance: Keeping high detection accuracy under edge constraints remains a major challenge. While LLMs are strong in natural language understanding and pattern recognition, their ability to generalize across different edge scenarios is often limited. This is especially an issue given the constantly changing nature of malware, which can reduce a model’s effectiveness in spotting new threats.  
- Susceptibility to Bias: Fine-tuning lightweight LLMs for malware detection can risk overfitting, making them vulnerable to biases. This can block their ability to detect new or polymorphic malware variants. Tackling this requires diverse training datasets, solid generalization strategies, and strong regularization techniques to ensure the models remain flexible and robust.  
- Feasibility of Deployment: Even though they are smaller, lightweight LLMs still require computational and energy resources that can challenge their practical use
on edge devices with limited capabilities. Improving their efficiency through methods like quantization, efficient neural architecture search, and low-power hardware acceleration is crucial for making these models usable in real-world situations.    

To deal with these challenges, this work explores a new structure that takes advantage of lightweight LLMs while addressing their weaknesses in edge computing
environments. The proposed structure improves malware detection by making the model more efficient, increasing its ability to adjust to new threats, and allowing for continuous learning, even with limited resources.  
To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted using several leading lightweight LLMs. This evaluation uses mul-
tiple publicly available datasets designed for edge and IoT security situations, including Edge-IIoTset, X-IIoTID, TON-IoT, and the CIC IoT Dataset 2023. These datasets include a wide range of real-world network traffic and malware samples, ensuring a thorough assessment of the models’ ability to spot complex
cyber threats. Moreover, the evaluation discusses the practicality of deploying the proposed solution across edge nodes with different computational resources. It provides insights into the trade-offs between detection performance, resource use, and real-time processing efficiency.  

The thesis is organized as follows. Chapter 2 contains an extensive overview of
how Large Language Models work, focusing on architecture, optimization, and the
models used in the experimental part. Chapter 3 analyzes the network data flows,
i.e., the chosen datasets, their sources, use-cases, and contents. Chapter 4 illustrates
the most common malware found in real scenarios reported in the datasets. Chapter
5 explains what edge devices are and how they can be useful for malware detection
and classification purposes. Chapter 6 presents a possible architecture that can be
applied for malware detection in edge scenarios, along with all the challenges that
could impact the result and how to deal with them. Chapter 7 extensively evaluates
the chosen set of experiments to determine the feasibility of the proposed solution.
Lastly, Chapter 8 explores future works and final notes.
